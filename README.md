## Module for making new mitocondrial alignments

001a/ For unpaired.bam files. Extracting unaligned reads & reads aligned against chrM in previous alignments done using mithocondrial genome J01415.2. These reads are used to build fastqz files.

001b/ For paired.bam files. Extracting unaligned reads & reads aligned against chrM in previous alignments done using mithocondrial genome J01415.2. These reads are used to build fastqz files.

002/ Use SNAP allignment module developed at inmegen. Makes new alignments using mithocondrial genome NC_012920.1, and using the fastq.gz files generated in 001a and 001b.
